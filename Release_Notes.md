# Purpose

The **[STDATALOG_PYSDK](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stdatalog-pysdk)** is a comprehensive Python framework designed to
facilitate the capture, processing, and visualization of data from a wide range of
sources, including sensors, algorithms, simulated signals, and telemetries from
actuators.

This software development kit is designed with an open and modular architecture,
making it an excellent resource for data scientists and embedded designers.
**STDATALOG-PYSDK** has been developed in **Python 3.12**, but it is compatible also with Python 3.11 and 3.10.

It provides a range of tools and utilities designed to simplify the development of
applications that use data from ST system solutions.

It includes Python scripts to create, elaborate, and organize data into structured
datasets. These datasets are compatible with mainstream data science toolchains,
promoting reusability across multiple projects. Additionally, the scripts can be easily
integrated into any data science design workflow.

It is formerly known as **HSDPython_SDK**, previously distributed in **FP-SNS-DATALOG1**, **FP-SNS-DATALOG2**, and **FP-IND-DATALOGMC** function packs
